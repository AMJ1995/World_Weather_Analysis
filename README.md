# Project Overview

For this project I used my Python and Pandas skills to access Google Maps APIs and create a travel itinerary for a beta tester. The tester is asked to type the minimum temperature and maximum temperature of cities they are interested in visiting, and a map is displayed with all of these destinations pinpointed on a Google Maps figure. I chose four cities in England to exemplify how this code can display a travel itinerary and guide you from city to city by walking, driving or bicycling. Attached in this repository are PNG images of these map figures.
